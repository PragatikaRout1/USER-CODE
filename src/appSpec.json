    "designSummary": "**The AI Frontier: Dynamic, Layered, and Predictive**\n\nThe design for Runway embodies the cutting edge of AI innovation. It's not just a website; it's an interactive portal into the future of reality simulation and creation. The aesthetic is a fusion of sophisticated, futuristic UI elements and the raw power of generative models. We aim for a 'sci-fi interface' feel, where every element communicates precision, intelligence, and forward momentum. The core principle is to create a sense of depth and dynamism through layered elements, subtle animations, and a carefully curated, high-contrast color palette that evokes advanced technology.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **Full-Bleed Canvas:** All sections will extend to the viewport edges, creating an immersive experience. Content will be strategically placed within this expansive space.\n2. **Asymmetrical Balance & Depth:** Layouts will leverage calculated asymmetry and overlapping elements to break from rigid grids, creating visual tension and a sense of advanced engineering.\n3. **Typography as Data:** Clean, geometric sans-serif fonts will be used for primary content, while monospaced fonts will be reserved for technical details or code-like elements, reinforcing the 'techy' persona.\n4. **The 8-Pixel Rhythm:** All spacing, padding, and margins will adhere to a strict 8px base unit to ensure visual harmony and precision across the dynamic layout.\n5. **Interactive Layers:** Components and sections will feature subtle, purposeful animations and 'glassmorphism' effects to suggest depth and interactivity, mimicking high-tech interfaces.",

(`text-2xl lg:text-4xl text-gray-300 text-center mt-4 z-10`).\nSignature Hook (Framer Motion Spec): Parent `motion.div` for the hero container uses `variants` with `transition: { staggerChildren: 0.05 }`. Headline `motion.h1` and sub-headline `motion.p` have variants with `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}` and `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`.
